# Architecture

## Purpose

This document describes the architecture of OpenVitals as it exists today, plus the direction new work should follow.

The repo now has one Android app module for the local app. The goal is to keep boundaries clear enough that new metrics can be added without copying screen scaffolding, period math, or Health Connect plumbing everywhere, while keeping code app-local until there is a concrete need for a new module.

## Current Snapshot

- App namespace: `tech.mmarca.openvitals`
- Project shape: two Gradle modules. The phone app is `:app`, under `app/`. `:wear` is a Wear OS placeholder with its own CI gate. The rest of this document is about `:app`
- Dependency wiring: Hilt in `:app`, rooted at [`OpenVitalsApp`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/OpenVitalsApp.kt); modules are `di/AppModule.kt`, `di/RepositoryModule.kt`, `di/PreferencesModule.kt`, `di/RemindersModule.kt`, and `di/DevicesModule.kt`
- UI stack: Jetpack Compose + Material 3 app shell + Navigation Compose + `ViewModel` + coroutines/`StateFlow`
- Health data backend: Health Connect AndroidX client, wrapped by [`HealthConnectManager`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/healthconnect/HealthConnectManager.kt)
- App-local domain code: pure models, insight calculations, and preference enums under [`domain`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/domain)
- Shared period shell: in place and used by all metric detail/list screens
- Feature repositories: in place for activity, sleep, heart, body, body energy, caffeine, hydration, nutrition, mindfulness, cycle, and vitals
- Dashboard: still a dedicated day-based summary screen, not a period-detail screen
- Manual entry: separate from the dashboard and writes explicit user-entered records directly to Health Connect
- Room is at schema version 16. It holds derived summary caches plus the tables Health Connect cannot represent (`garmin_wellness_samples`, `garmin_sleep_minutes`, `synced_record_origins`, the food catalog, the cycle journal, cycle exclusions, pill intakes, the index of kept medical documents, and the weigh-ins a scale broadcast); Health Connect remains the source of truth for everything it has a record type for
- WorkManager is used for user-started Apple Health imports, offline map imports, the home widget refresh, the opt-in periodic watch sync, and the re-arm of the scale listener
- Device integration lives under [`devices`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/devices): the Garmin GFDI protocol stack, the shared BLE radio lease, companion-device pairing, notification forwarding, and the listener for a bathroom scale that only broadcasts
- Phone-to-phone Health Connect sync lives under [`features/devicesync`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/devicesync) and runs over Bluetooth Classic RFCOMM
- A one-time Flutter-to-Kotlin data migrator lives under [`data/migration`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/migration) and runs from `OpenVitalsApp.onCreate()`

Most importantly, body and entry/session browsing now live in metric-owned detail screens. The former global Browse destination is no longer part of the app architecture.

### Top-Level Package Map

| Package | Owns |
|---|---|
| `comaps/` | the CoMaps navigation provider: the `ContentResolver` source and the guidance feed |
| `core/` | app-wide primitives: `period`, `presentation`, `stats`, `geo`, `fit`, `performance`, `diagnostics`, `export` (share staging), `permissions` (OS runtime permissions) |
| `data/` | `local` (Room), `repository` (feature-facing repositories + `contract` interfaces), `sync` (history/backfill services), `migration` (one-time Flutter import) |
| `devices/` | device integration: `core` (ports, radio lease, pairing), `garmin` (GFDI stack), `wearos`, `notifications` (notification listener), `media` (the phone's players, for music controls), `weather` (the weather a watch asks for), `xiaomi` (the S400 scale: broadcast decoding, the background listener and the weigh-in import) |
| `di/` | `AppModule`, `RepositoryModule`, `PreferencesModule`, `RemindersModule`, `DevicesModule` |
| `domain/` | pure code: `model`, `insights`, `preferences`, `query`, `usecase`, `cycle`, `dashboard` (the aggregator), `report` (report roll-ups), `medical` (FHIR parsing, id repair, source grouping, the patient check, record summaries, the export bundle) |
| `features/` | one package per user-facing feature area |
| `healthconnect/` | the Health Connect integration boundary: manager, per-area readers, permission/UX services |
| `navigation/` | routes and graph registration |
| `sensors/ble/` | live BLE sensor streaming during activity recording |
| `ui/` | shared components, charts, theme |

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Feature-first code organization

New product work should live under `features/<feature>/`.

Each feature owns:

- screen composables
- screen `UiState`
- screen `ViewModel`
- feature-specific charts, cards, rows, and formatting

Shared code should only move out of a feature when it is clearly reused by multiple screens.

### 2. Shared shell, feature-owned visuals

The app now has a real shared shell for period-based screens:

- pull to refresh
- range selector
- period navigator
- date picker
- shared loading/error framing

That shell belongs in shared UI.

The actual metric presentation stays feature-local:

- steps charts
- sleep session timeline and stage bars
- heart trend/timeline cards
- workout rows
- weight/body composition cards

We do not want a universal chart abstraction that hides metric meaning.

### 3. Period-driven detail screens

The canonical interaction model for metric screens is:

- `Day / Week / Month / Year`
- selected anchor date
- previous/next navigation
- direct calendar selection
- forward navigation capped at the current period
- last selected range remembered independently per detail/list screen

This pattern is implemented today by app-local period primitives in `core/period` and shell components in `ui/components`.

### 4. ViewModels own screen state and orchestration

Screens stay thin. ViewModels are responsible for:

- selected range/date state
- triggering loads and refreshes
- combining repository calls
- exposing UI-ready state

Screens should mostly collect state, wire callbacks, and render sections.

### 5. Repositories are feature-facing and permission-aware

Health Connect specifics stay below the feature layer.

Repository methods should answer feature questions such as:

- load workouts for a period
- load sleep sessions for a period
- load heart summaries for a period
- load body entries for a period

They should not keep growing into one large grab-bag repository with screen-specific overloads.

### 6. Keep abstractions proportional

The current app does not need:

- a reducer/effect architecture
- a multi-module split
- a raw Health Connect mirror

Two Room caches exist, and each has a reason: the vitals daily cache, because seven vitals types have no Health Connect aggregate, and `heart_rate_days`, because the day view's average needs every sample.
The first is invalidated by a permission-and-zone fingerprint, the second by a per-day signature of the hourly aggregates.
Everything else reads Health Connect on every load, through one reader function per metric and shape. A new cache needs a fingerprint and a reason as strong as these.

### 7. Keep module boundaries proportional

The current project should stay single-module unless a future app or library has a concrete, active need for extracted code. Prefer package boundaries first:

- app-local domain models and calculations in `domain`
- period primitives in `core/period`
- app-only resources, navigation, Hilt wiring, and local policy in `:app`

## Logical Layers In The Current App

These are logical layers inside the local app module.

### App shell

Responsibilities:

- app startup
- Hilt application/component setup
- theme setup
- route registration
- adaptive top app bar, navigation suite, and global action shell

Current files:

- [`OpenVitalsApp.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/OpenVitalsApp.kt)
- [`MainActivity.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/MainActivity.kt)
- [`di/AppModule.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/di/AppModule.kt)
- [`navigation/AppNavigation.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/navigation/AppNavigation.kt)
- [`navigation/Screen.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/navigation/Screen.kt)
- [`ui/components/OpenVitalsAdaptiveScaffold.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/OpenVitalsAdaptiveScaffold.kt)

Notes:

- `OpenVitalsApp` owns the Hilt application component and locale bootstrap.
- `MainActivity` owns the onboarding-complete preference and chooses the start destination.
- `AppNavigation` owns route registration and top-level destination selection; route composables obtain `@HiltViewModel` instances through `hiltViewModel()`.
- `OpenVitalsAdaptiveScaffold` owns the Material 3 top app bar, `NavigationSuiteScaffold`, and contextual Add action.

### Data access

Responsibilities:

- Health Connect availability checks
- permission queries
- record reads and aggregate reads
- explicit manual-entry writes to Health Connect
- mapping Health Connect responses into app models
- feature-facing repository APIs

Current files:

- [`healthconnect/HealthConnectManager.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/healthconnect/HealthConnectManager.kt)
- [`data/repository/HealthRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/HealthRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/ActivityRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/ActivityRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/SleepRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/SleepRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/HeartRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/HeartRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/BodyRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/BodyRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/HydrationRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/HydrationRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/NutritionRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/NutritionRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/MindfulnessRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/MindfulnessRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/CycleRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/CycleRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/VitalsRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/VitalsRepository.kt)
- [`data/repository/PreferencesRepository.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/PreferencesRepository.kt)
- feature-oriented model files under [`domain/model`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/domain/model)

Current boundary shape:

- `HealthConnectManager` is the low-level integration wrapper. It talks to the AndroidX client, performs reads, writes explicit manual entries, and maps results into app models.
- `HealthRepository` is now intentionally narrow: Health Connect availability and permission state. Dashboard loading is `DashboardDataLoader`, behind `LoadDashboardDayUseCase`.
- Feature repositories are thin, permission-aware facades over `HealthConnectManager`.
- Manual entry ViewModels use the same feature repositories for writes, so write permission and write behavior stay below the UI route.
- `healthconnect` depends on app-local domain models; repositories depend on `healthconnect` and `domain`. The readers, writers and mappers import nothing from `data.repository`. Five permission and gate classes do: they read `PreferencesRepository`, and one reads the `HealthRepository` contract. `HealthConnectLayeringTest` lists them and fails on a sixth.

This is a meaningful improvement over the earlier centralized repository approach. New feature reads should follow the feature-repository pattern, not expand `HealthRepository`.

Some repositories are now split into a `data/repository/contract/` interface and an implementation, bound in `di/RepositoryModule.kt`. Use that split when a repository is a seam another subsystem writes through, not by default.

### Local storage

[`OpenVitalsDatabase`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/local/OpenVitalsDatabase.kt) is at `VERSION = 16`, with migrations declared in its companion object and listed once, in `ALL_MIGRATIONS`, which the database builder takes. Room exports the schema of each version to [`app/schemas`](../../app/schemas); the files are committed.

To change the schema: raise `VERSION`, write the migration, add it to `ALL_MIGRATIONS`, build once, and commit the new schema file. `OpenVitalsDatabaseSchemaTest` fails until all of that is done: it replays every migration's statements and compares the tables they leave with the exported schema. It can do that on the JVM because the migrations only create and drop tables. A migration that alters a table needs a real database, so add `room-testing` and a `MigrationTestHelper` test with it; the exported schemas are what that helper reads.

| Table | Package | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `beverages` | `data/local/beverage` | user and preloaded beverage catalog |
| `vitals_daily_aggregates`, `vitals_sync_cursors` | `data/local/vitalscache` | derived daily summary cache and change-token cursors |
| `body_energy_days`, `body_energy_buckets` | `data/local/bodyenergy` | the Body Energy chain, moved off SharedPreferences in migration 4 → 5 |
| `garmin_wellness_samples` | `data/local/garmin` | watch-only wellness series, added in migration 5 → 6 |
| `synced_record_origins` | `data/local/syncorigin` | the source app of each record received from another phone, added in migration 6 → 7 |
| `garmin_sleep_minutes` | `data/local/garmin` | per-minute input for estimated sleep stages, added in migration 9 → 10 |
| `heart_rate_days` | `data/local/heartratecache` | each day's heart-rate average from raw samples, read again when the day's hourly aggregates change, added in migration 10 → 11 |
| `foods`, `food_nutrients` | `data/local/food` | the user's food catalog and each food's nutrients, added in migration 11 → 12; a logged portion is a Health Connect nutrition record, not a row |
| `cycle_journal_entries`, `cycle_exclusions` | `data/local/cycle` | the cycle day log Health Connect has no record type for (pain, mood, energy, symptoms, notes, pregnancy test, temperature disturbances, cervical sensation) and the cycles kept out of the estimate, added in migration 12 → 13 |
| `pill_intakes` | `data/local/cycle` | the days the contraceptive pill was marked as taken; the scheme itself is a cycle preference, added in migration 13 → 14 |
| `medical_documents`, `medical_document_records` | `data/local/medical` | the files kept from medical imports, stored under `files/medical_documents`, and the Health Connect records each one gave; a file is data Health Connect cannot hold, and the records stay in Health Connect. Added in migration 14 → 15 |
| `scale_weigh_ins` | `data/local/scale` | each weigh-in a scale broadcast, as measured: weight, heart rate and the two body impedances. Health Connect has no type for impedance, and a weigh-in heard with the app closed must outlive a refused write. Added in migration 15 → 16 |

`garmin_wellness_samples` is the one table that is not a cache. It is the system of record for the series a Garmin watch produces that Health Connect has no record type for (stress, Body Battery, watch sleep scores). Its schema is `(metric, time_millis, value)` with `(metric, time_millis)` as the primary key, so re-syncing an overlapping window rewrites rows instead of duplicating them.

Access goes through [`GarminWellnessRepository`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/repository/contract/GarminWellnessRepository.kt), which is deliberately a thin seam: `upsert`, `samplesBetween`, `latest`, `countFor` and nothing else. No windowing, aggregation, or interpretation happens there. It exists so the Garmin sync pipeline (which writes after decoding FIT wellness files) and the readers that chart or derive from these series never reach for the DAO directly. Keep it that way; interpretation belongs in `domain` or the feature.

### Startup and the one-time Flutter migration

[`data/migration`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/data/migration) holds a one-shot importer that brings Flutter-era user data forward. The Kotlin build installs over the Flutter build with the same `applicationId` and certificate, so the app's private directory survives the swap, and the Kotlin-era files still sitting in it are about a month stale. The migrator therefore overwrites them with the Flutter values on its guarded first run.

It is deliberately split into two phases around `super.onCreate()` in [`OpenVitalsApp`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/OpenVitalsApp.kt). This ordering is load-bearing, not stylistic:

1. **Preferences, before `super.onCreate()`.** `@HiltAndroidApp` member-injects the `Application` *during* `super.onCreate()`, and `PreferencesRepository` eagerly snapshots its `SharedPreferences` into `StateFlow`s at construction. Any preference write that lands after that point is invisible to the running app. So `FlutterDataMigrator` is constructed by hand rather than injected, and every preference write goes through raw `SharedPreferences` with `commit()` rather than through a repository that may not exist yet.
2. **Database import, after `super.onCreate()`.** The database phase needs the Hilt-provided Room singleton, which cannot exist before the Hilt component does. Room singletons are created lazily on first request, and no `Activity` can exist yet, so resolving `OpenVitalsDatabase` through `FlutterMigrationEntryPoint` immediately after `super.onCreate()` is both possible and safe.

`migrateIfNeeded()` returns whether a migration is in flight; only then does `onCreate` call `importDatabaseAndFinish(...)`. The migrator never throws, sets its one-shot flag regardless of per-step failures so a failing migration cannot retry on every launch, never deletes a Flutter file, and no-ops on a fresh install after a single file stat.

If you add a new preference or store that must survive the migration, add it to phase 1. Do not move phase 1 work behind Hilt.

### Shared UI / presentation

Responsibilities:

- reusable shell components
- period selection primitives
- date navigation UI
- loading/error primitives
- dashboard/detail card building blocks

Current files:

- [`ui/components/MetricDetailScaffold.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/MetricDetailScaffold.kt)
- [`ui/components/PeriodNavigator.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/PeriodNavigator.kt)
- [`ui/components/DateNavigation.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/DateNavigation.kt)
- [`ui/components/MetricCard.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/MetricCard.kt)
- [`ui/components/LoadingState.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/LoadingState.kt)
- [`ui/components/PullToRefreshBox.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/PullToRefreshBox.kt)
- [`ui/components/PermissionCallout.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/PermissionCallout.kt)
- [`ui/components/DeviceShell.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/DeviceShell.kt) and [`ui/components/OsPermissionsDialog.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/OsPermissionsDialog.kt): the avatar, value row, time format and Android-permissions checklist every paired-device screen (watches, scales) shares

Important current detail:

- `TimeRange`, `DatePeriod`, `PeriodLoadQuery`, `PeriodWindows`, `PeriodSelectionDriver`, and period formatting helpers live in `core/period`
- `PeriodRangePreferenceKey` lives in `core/period`; `PreferencesRepository` persists the last selected `TimeRange` per detail/list screen
- `PeriodNavigator` remains a UI component in `ui/components`

### Feature layer

Responsibilities:

- feature contracts (`UiState`, actions, derived display fields)
- screen-specific orchestration
- feature-specific cards/charts/lists
- feature-specific display language

Current feature packages:

- [`features/achievements`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/achievements)
- [`features/onboarding`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/onboarding)
- [`features/dashboard`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/dashboard)
- [`features/activity`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/activity)
- [`features/sleep`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/sleep)
- [`features/heart`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/heart)
- [`features/vitals`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/vitals)
- [`features/body`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/body)
- [`features/bodyenergy`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/bodyenergy)
- [`features/caffeine`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/caffeine)
- [`features/cycle`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/cycle)
- [`features/devicesync`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/devicesync)
- [`features/homewidgets`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/homewidgets)
- [`features/hydration`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/hydration)
- [`features/imports/applehealth`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/imports/applehealth)
- [`features/imports/csv`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/imports/csv)
- [`features/manualentry`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry)
- [`features/mindfulness`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/mindfulness)
- [`features/nutrition`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/nutrition)
- [`features/readiness`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/readiness)
- [`features/recovery`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/recovery)
- [`features/scales`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/scales)
- [`features/settings`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/settings)
- [`features/watches`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/watches)
- [`features/workoutplans`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/workoutplans) — plan list/builder; `WorkoutPlanStepMapping.kt` is the one seam between Health Connect plans and the activity form's step rows

Four of these are not metric features and follow their own shape: `features/watches` is the watch UI over the `devices` layer, `features/scales` is the settings screen for the scale listener in `devices/xiaomi`, `features/devicesync` is a phone-to-phone sync wizard, and `features/imports/*` are import workflows.

One practical note: `features/activity` currently contains two screen families:

- concrete metric entry screens such as `StepsScreen`, `DistanceScreen`, `CaloriesOutScreen`, `ActiveCaloriesScreen`, `FloorsScreen`, and `ElevationScreen`
- `ActivitiesScreen` for workout sessions

That is a reasonable local compromise today because these screens share `ActivityRepository`, but route-facing composables should stay metric-specific. Shared renderers inside a feature package are acceptable when they only remove local duplication and do not make the user-facing detail screen show several metrics at once.

Two implemented features intentionally do not follow the canonical period-detail interaction:

- `features/caffeine` is a caffeine-specific analytics and setup experience with custom ranges, active-caffeine modeling, timing guidance, and beverage/nutrition context.
- `features/bodyenergy` is a selected-day derived wellness detail, not a `Day / Week / Month / Year` metric screen.

### Cross-metric insights

Cross-metric insight calculations should live in `domain/insights`, even when the card is rendered by one feature. The feature ViewModel or use case can load the secondary signal, and the presentation mapper can attach the resulting insight to the feature display state.

This keeps metric UI declarative: composables render precomputed insight models and do not own thresholds, correlation rules, or score adjustments. Missing secondary data should remain neutral. For example, planned caffeine-aware sleep insights should attach caffeine signals to sleep presentation state only after the domain signal and mapper are implemented; missing caffeine records must not reduce sleep scores. Today, caffeine timing guidance lives in the standalone caffeine feature.

## Shared FIT Decoding

[`core/fit/FitDecoder.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/core/fit/FitDecoder.kt) is the one FIT decoder in the app. It was extracted from the route importer's private decoder once a second consumer appeared.

It is a generic container walk and nothing more: it reads the FIT header, definition and data messages, compressed timestamps and developer fields, and returns `FitMessage` values keyed by global message number. It has no message allowlist and no semantics.

Interpretation lives with the consumer, and the two interpreters are disjoint:

- [`features/manualentry/activity/routeimport/FitRouteParser.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/activity/routeimport/FitRouteParser.kt) interprets activity, course, and workout files.
- [`devices/garmin/wellness/GarminFitWellness.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/devices/garmin/wellness/GarminFitWellness.kt) interprets the Garmin-proprietary wellness messages a watch sync downloads.

An activity file therefore yields empty wellness carriers and a wellness file yields no route, without either side needing to know about the other. A third FIT consumer should follow the same split: reuse `FitDecoder`, own its interpretation.

## Device Layer

`devices/` is a layer, not a feature. It owns everything that talks to a physical device over Bluetooth and exposes ports that features consume. It has no Compose code and no navigation. The user-facing screens live in `features/watches` and `features/scales`.

### `devices/core`

Vendor-neutral ports plus the two things every integration shares.

- [`RadioLease.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/devices/core/RadioLease.kt) — `object RadioLeases`, a process-wide lease keyed **per Bluetooth address**. Two holders on different peripherals is allowed by design; two holders on the same peripheral is not.
- [`RadioLeaseUse.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/devices/core/RadioLeaseUse.kt) — `withRadioLease(address, owner) { ... }`, `RadioLeaseBusyException`, and `object RadioLeaseOwner` with the four owner tags: `SYNC`, `FIND`, `SETTINGS`, `NOTIFICATIONS`. They are strings rather than an enum because they appear in logcat.
- `DeviceClassification.kt` / `DeviceScanClassifier.kt` — `DeviceClassifier` and `DeviceScanClassifier` function interfaces; the first non-null classification wins, otherwise the device is a plain sensor.
- `core/pairing/` — `WatchPairingPort` (bond, unbond, associate, disassociate), its `BleWatchPairing` implementation, `CompanionDevicePairing` around `CompanionDeviceManager`, `OpenVitalsCompanionDeviceService`, and `CompanionPresenceObserver`. The service is declared first in the manifest and is therefore the app's primary companion service, the only one Android tells that an associated device appeared; it passes that to every observer bound `@IntoSet` in `di/DevicesModule.kt`.
- `core/sync/DeviceSyncPort.kt` — `canSync(device)` plus a progress-reporting `sync(...)`, so the watch UI never names a vendor.

### `devices/garmin`

The GFDI protocol stack, bottom to top. Everything above the GATT client is transport-free and unit-testable:

| Layer | Files |
|---|---|
| Byte primitives | `GarminByteReader/Writer`, `GarminCrc`, `GarminCobs`, `GarminProtobuf`, `GarminTime`, `GarminLog` |
| BLE transport | `GarminUuids`, `GarminGattClient` (the only file touching `android.bluetooth`), `GarminGattProbe`, `GarminTransport`, `GarminTransportProbe`, `GarminFrameTransport`, `GarminV1Transport`, `GarminMlTransport`, `GarminMlServiceChannel`, `GarminMlrChannel` |
| Framing | `GarminGfdiFrame` |
| Message vocabulary | `GarminMessages`, `GarminCapabilities` |
| Session | `GarminSession`, `GarminSessionResponders`, `GarminStageTimers`, `GarminHeldSyncOwner`, `GarminProtobufTransport`, `GarminFitCapabilities` |
| File sync | `GarminWatchSyncService`, `GarminDirectory` (legacy listing), `GarminFileSyncProtocol` and `GarminFileSyncTransfer` (protobuf listing and download), `GarminSyncProtocol`, `GarminFileTypes`, `GarminFileStore`, `GarminDeviceStateStore`, `GarminCounterWatermarkStore`, `GarminActivityImporter` |
| Wellness import | `wellness/GarminFitWellness` (decode), `wellness/FitWellnessExtras` (Pulse Ox, HRV values, thresholds, scores, restless moments), `wellness/FitWellnessImport` and `wellness/FitWellnessExtrasImport` (mapping), `wellness/FitWellnessImporter` (orchestration) |
| Notifications | `GarminNotificationBridge` (also the watch's `CompanionPresenceObserver`), `GarminNotificationForwarder`, `GarminNotificationLink`, `GarminGncsHandler`, `GarminNotificationMessages`, `GarminNotificationActions` |
| Settings link | `GarminSettingsLink`, `GarminSettingsService`, `GarminSettingsModel` |
| Onboarding | `OnboardGarminWatchUseCase`, `GarminDeviceClassifier`, `GarminDeviceNames`, `GarminPhoneIdentity` |

Notes worth carrying:

- `GarminWatchSyncService` is a `@Singleton` class, not an Android `Service`, despite the name. It implements `DeviceSyncPort`.
- The GATT client prefers V2 multi-link and falls back to the direct V1 pair. V2 startup waits for `CLOSE_ALL_RESP` before registering GFDI; do not collapse the two writes into one batch.
- A logical GFDI frame is one transport write, however many BLE chunks it takes. Both transports hold their send mutex across the whole COBS frame, or concurrent traffic interleaves into corrupt frames.
- Complete protobuf messages get the extended request-id ACK; a watch that NAKs it with `LENGTH_ERROR` gets the generic ACK for the rest of the connection. Chunks always get the extended ACK. The history behind that is on `GarminProtobufTransport.extendedAcks`.
- A file pull sends `FILTER`, waits for its answer (a NAK or silence lists anyway), then requests the legacy directory. `FILTER` is sent again in reply to an announcement. An empty legacy listing on a V2 watch not yet proven legacy probes the protobuf `FileSyncService`, which streams files over a temporary reliable-ML channel. The proven protocol is remembered per device; a timeout leaves it `UNKNOWN`, never "unsupported".
- Once a session finishes or aborts its result is sealed: a kept-open link still answers the watch but ignores directory, download and announcement messages, so nothing is archived outside the result.
- Newer firmware announces recordings over `FileSyncService`, not the legacy `SYNCHRONIZATION` message. Both run the same held-link handoff; a watch whose legacy directory lists nothing is handed to the owner for a full sync instead.
- A held companion link never ends its session over a transfer. A stall cancels only the transfer (`GarminSession.cancelTransfer`), imports what was persisted, and keeps listening. The forwarder holds the radio for a transfer for at most `maxSyncHold` before yielding to a user-started sync.
- Stage timeouts are named on `GarminSession`'s constructor with their reasons; the radio's thirty-minute limit is only a whole-sync safety net, wide enough for a first sync of a watch holding months of activities. A partial pull is imported but reported as interrupted, so a dropped link is not mistaken for an empty sync.
- Link policy: `GarminGattClient` writes with the characteristic's own write type (with a response when the watch offers one), redials up to three times after a stack error such as status 133 with a settle pause between dials but never after silence, and asks for a 515-byte MTU unless the watch's `GarminDeviceStateStore.highMtu` is off, the per-address switch under "Large Bluetooth packets" on the watch screen for a watch that misbehaves with big packets.
- A watch that never sends CONFIGURATION still completes the handshake: `GarminFitCapabilities` reads `connectivity_supported` from the FIT `capabilities` record some watches push as FIT_DEFINITION and FIT_DATA messages, and `GarminSession.completeInitialisation` runs the same start-up sequence from it. Those two messages are answered with the companion's status, ACK plus the APPLIED code.
- Monitoring FIT records often carry only `timestamp_16`; resolve it to the nearest rollover in either direction (`resolveMonitoringTimestamp16`), or samples shift by 65,536 seconds.
- Logs identify protobuf traffic by type, request id, status and byte count. Never log raw protobuf, settings or unknown-message payloads: they can carry notification text, locations or credentials.
- Archiving is irreversible, and the import runs only after the whole pull, so nothing downloaded may be dropped on the way. A session that fails after a download still returns the files it has, as an abort does. `GarminFileStore.save` leaves a `.pending` note beside each file; `markImported` removes it once an import is done with the file, and the next sync imports what `pending()` still holds before it lists the watch. That covers a crash or an exception between the download and the import.
- A downloaded file's key is recorded only once the file is dealt with. The watch archives a file as it downloads, so the key is the only thing that brings it back. A workout that did not reach Health Connect (no write access, or a failed write) keeps no key, the sync reports it as a failure, and the next sync fetches it again. A file that does not convert is done with.
- A watch sync writes Health Connect records through `AppleHealthImportRepository.insertImportedRecords`, the same deterministic-`clientRecordId` path the Apple Health importer uses, so a re-import upserts instead of duplicating. Only the watch-only series go to `GarminWellnessRepository`.
- Activity files take their own path, shared with the bulk folder import: `RouteFileImport.toImportWriteRequest` builds the request straight from the parsed file, and `ActivityRepository.writeActivityEntries` writes it. The client ids are a function of a hash of the file's bytes, so a second import of the same file updates its records instead of adding a second workout, and a watch's file is stored as recorded by a watch. A headless import must not go through the entry form's text fields: that lost the seconds, rounded the duration up, and gave every record a random id.
- The OS bond is the security boundary. GFDI's own auth challenge is answered with zeroes, so `OnboardGarminWatchUseCase` treats bonding as mandatory and the companion association as optional.

### `devices/wearos`

Classification and onboarding only. There is no protocol: `OnboardWearOsWatchUseCase` has a single `ASSOCIATING` step, and the device is registered with no capabilities.

### `devices/xiaomi`

The Xiaomi Body Composition Scale S400. The scale takes no connection: it broadcasts each weigh-in as MiBeacon v5 frames in the service data of `0xFE95`, sealed with AES-CCM under a bind key the Xiaomi account issued when the scale was paired. The user pastes that key once; the app never sees the account.

| Layer | Files |
|---|---|
| Decoding, transport-free | `AesCcm` (RFC 3610 on the AES block cipher: Android ships no CCM), `S400Beacon` (header rules, nonce, the weigh-in object, the scan-filter bytes) |
| Health Connect mapping | `S400WeighInImport` (record kinds, ids, record time) |
| Listening | `ScaleScanRadio` (the one file here touching `android.bluetooth.le`; `devices/core/pairing/CompanionDevicePairing` builds the dialog's filters), `ScaleScanReceiver`, `XiaomiScaleListener` (also the `CompanionPresenceObserver`), `ScaleListeningService` and its `ScaleForeground` port, `ScaleListenerWorker`, `ScaleLog` |
| Pipeline | `ScaleWeighInIngest` (decode, fold into Room, write), `ScaleWeighInWriter` (Room to Health Connect, retries, delete) |
| State | `XiaomiScaleStore` (key, address, user slot, last failure) |

Notes worth carrying:

- The scan is the system's, started with a `PendingIntent`. It outlives the process, and the system starts `ScaleScanReceiver` for each broadcast that passes the filter. The filter is matched in the Bluetooth chip: `0xFE95` service data, the product id, the "encrypted object" control bits, and the scale's address once known. The scale's idle beacons and a neighbour's scale wake nobody.
- Measured on an S400: the scale advertises idle beacons from the moment someone steps on, and sends the result only once it has finished measuring, as two frames repeated for about a second each, some twenty seconds in. Its timestamp is true UTC. A scale that does not recognise the person shows "----" and broadcasts no result at all.
- Two seconds on the air is too short for a background scan, which the system runs a tenth of the time, and a twentieth with the screen off on Android 13 and later. So adding a scale goes through Android's companion dialog (`XiaomiScaleListener.findScale`, `CompanionDevicePairing.discover`): it lists the S400s it hears, and the one picked is associated and watched for presence, which is also how the app learns the scale's address and advertised name. `allowSystemWake` asks again for a user who revoked that in Android's settings. When Android reports the scale awake, the listener opens a window of `WEIGH_IN_WINDOW_MILLIS`: it starts `ScaleListeningService`, a foreground service that runs no logic, restarts the scan so it runs at foreground speed from its first moment, and closes both when both frames are in or the window runs out. Verified on a dozing Pixel with the process dead: wake at 0 s, both frames at 23 s. Android tells only the app's primary companion service, `OpenVitalsCompanionDeviceService`, which is why that one passes the event to the observers.
- Each frame is still folded into its row as it arrives and the weigh-in is written again if it grows, so a frame missed on a phone that was not woken, or on Android 10 and 11, still saves what was heard.
- Room comes before Health Connect. The scale says each weigh-in once, and a background write cannot ask for a permission. A weigh-in Health Connect has not taken stays pending and is retried on the next frame, at app start, by the worker and when the Scales screen opens.
- A weigh-in is `(scale timestamp, user slot)`. Record ids are built from those two and from no address, since ids travel to other phones. `clientRecordVersion` is the row's `updated_millis`, so a fuller rewrite replaces the earlier records.
- Only what the key authenticates counts. An unsealed object is ignored, and the first sealed frame the key opens says which of the scale's user slots is this person's. A frame from another slot is someone else's body: it is dropped, and only the slot number is kept so the screen can offer to switch. A new key (the scale was paired again in Xiaomi Home) keeps the scale: its address is its identity.
- A reboot, or Bluetooth going off, drops the scan, and no broadcast tells a closed app that Bluetooth is back. `XiaomiScaleListener` arms it again at every process start, and `ScaleListenerWorker` every half hour.
- Android 12 and later listen with the app closed. Android 10 and 11 would need background location for that, which the app does not ask for, so there weigh-ins arrive while the app is open.
- Body composition is an estimate from Sun et al. (2003) in `domain/insights/BioimpedanceComposition`, not what the scale displays. No basal metabolic rate is written: a second source would evict `BmrEstimateService`'s daily estimate on weigh-in days.
- Never log the key, a decrypted payload, a measurement or the address.

### `devices/notifications`

`OpenVitalsNotificationListenerService` is the platform `NotificationListenerService`. It reads posted notifications, filters them through the pure `NotificationFilter`, buffers them in the memory-only `NotificationStore`, and hands them to `GarminNotificationBridge`. It touches no Bluetooth; the bridge owns the forwarding. Nothing is written to a file or a database.

### Hilt wiring

`di/DevicesModule.kt` is the only module for this layer. It binds `BleWatchPairing` to `WatchPairingPort` and `GarminWatchSyncService` to `DeviceSyncPort`, binds `AndroidPhoneMediaSource` to `PhoneMediaSource`, binds `SystemScaleScanRadio` to `ScaleScanRadio` and `ScaleListeningForeground` to `ScaleForeground`, adds `XiaomiScaleListener` to the `CompanionPresenceObserver` set, and provides the GATT probe, the two Garmin `SharedPreferences`-backed stores, the one `GarminFileStore` and the one `XiaomiScaleStore`. Everything else is constructor injection. There are no `@Module` declarations inside `devices/` itself; keep it that way. `DevicesLayeringTest` fails on one.

Live BLE sensor streaming during activity recording still lives in `sensors/ble`. Phone-to-phone sync is `features/devicesync`, below.

## Phone-To-Phone Sync

[`features/devicesync`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/devicesync) copies Health Connect records between two phones over Bluetooth Classic RFCOMM. It is a feature, not part of `devices/`, because it talks to another instance of this app rather than to a peripheral.

Three sub-packages, in dependency order:

- `bluetooth/` — the only Android Bluetooth code. `BluetoothSyncManager` (`@Singleton`) owns discoverability, discovery, the socket, and the transport; `RfcommServer`/`RfcommClient` open the socket on a private app UUID; `RfcommByteChannel` pumps bytes; `BluetoothDiscoveryReceiver` bridges the discovery broadcasts.
- `protocol/` — pure Kotlin over a `SyncByteTransport` seam, so the whole protocol is testable over an in-memory pipe with no Bluetooth. `SyncFrame` is a length-prefixed frame whose `SyncFrameType` ordinal is the wire byte, so the enum is append-only. `SyncMessages` carries `SYNC_PROTOCOL_VERSION` and compact JSON payloads with a gzipped record batch. `SyncPairing` holds the cryptography: an ECDH P-256 exchange with a committed host key, HKDF, six digits the two users compare, and `SyncFrameCipher` (AES-256-GCM, one key per direction, a frame counter as nonce). `SyncSession` is the state machine: handshake, key exchange, code check, negotiate types, then a symmetric bidirectional exchange where both phones run the same code and differ only by `SyncRole`. No record frame is accepted until both users confirmed the code, and every frame after the key exchange except an abort is sealed. Never go back to a typed code proved with a MAC: six digits can be guessed offline from one recorded handshake.
- `store/` — the data side, kept out of the protocol. `SyncRecordCodec` encodes and decodes records and derives the content fingerprint used for dedup; `HealthConnectSyncStore` implements the protocol's `SyncRecordStore` for Health Connect records; `CycleJournalSyncStore` carries the cycle journal from Room; `MedicalRecordsSyncStore` carries FHIR medical records as export entries and writes them through the medical import pipeline; `CompositeSyncStore` routes each record type to one of them; `DeviceSyncReportStore` writes the last report as plain text under `filesDir/device_sync/`.

There is no Room table and no DataStore here. What sync persists is Health Connect itself, plus that one report file.

`DeviceSyncForegroundService` is an inert keep-alive: the RFCOMM pumps run in the wizard's ViewModel, and the service exists only to hold the foreground slot for the duration of a transfer. `start()` is best-effort and `stop()` only ever stops its own class, so a sync that never got the slot cannot tear down someone else's service.

## Screen Families

### Dashboard

The dashboard is intentionally different from the period-based detail screens.

It is:

- a daily snapshot
- navigated by day only
- powered by one aggregated `DashboardData` object
- the main entry point into feature screens

Current files:

- [`features/dashboard/DashboardViewModel.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/dashboard/DashboardViewModel.kt)
- [`features/dashboard/DashboardScreen.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/dashboard/DashboardScreen.kt)

Shared pieces it uses:

- `PullToRefreshBox`
- `DayNavigator`
- `HealthDatePickerDialog`
- `MetricCard`
- `PermissionCallout`

The dashboard should stay summary-first. It should not become a second copy of detail-screen logic.

Dashboard metric cards route to metric-specific detail destinations. Metrics that share a repository can still reuse the same feature package and ViewModel, but navigation should call concrete metric screen entry points such as `ProteinScreen` or `RestingHeartRateScreen`, not a public screen with a metric parameter. The rendered detail view should focus on the selected metric instead of showing every related metric in one grouped screen. There is no global records browser or fixed dashboard browse action; entry and session lists belong behind the relevant metric card/detail screen.

### Manual entry

Manual entry is a separate screen family from the dashboard. It is the only app area that should initiate *user-entered* Health Connect writes. The Add entry picker is reached through contextual create actions on the dashboard and supported metric screens, not as a primary browsing destination.

The other write paths are all imports or transfers rather than typed entry: `features/imports/applehealth`, `features/imports/csv`, `features/devicesync`, the Garmin wellness import, and the scale's weigh-ins. They share one write door, `AppleHealthImportRepository.insertImportedRecords`, so deterministic `clientRecordId` upserts behave identically across them. Medical records (FHIR) are the exception. They have no `clientRecordId`, so they are written through `healthconnect/MedicalRecordsWriter`, where a record's data source, type and id make a rewrite an update.

Current files:

- [`features/manualentry/ManualEntryScreen.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/ManualEntryScreen.kt)
- [`features/manualentry/ManualEntryViewModel.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/ManualEntryViewModel.kt)
- [`features/manualentry/activity`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/activity)
- [`features/manualentry/activity/recording`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/activity/recording)
- [`features/manualentry/activity/routeimport`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/activity/routeimport)
- [`features/manualentry/hydration`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/hydration)
- [`features/manualentry/food`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/food)
- [`features/manualentry/nutrition`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/nutrition)
- [`features/manualentry/body`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/body)
- [`features/manualentry/vitals`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/vitals)
- [`features/manualentry/mindfulness`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/mindfulness)

The current manual entry widgets cover hydration, food from a catalog the user builds, carbohydrate totals, activity sessions with manual entry, existing plans, or GPS recording, activity file review launched from Settings Data Importers for GPX/KML/KMZ, TCX, and FIT files, mindfulness, weight, height, body fat, blood pressure, SpO2, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Widget order is customizable in the same spirit as the dashboard, but the dashboard remains read-only.

Write permissions can be requested during one-tap onboarding or lazily from Add entry and the specific metric entry route. The dashboard remains read-only. Each write goes directly to Health Connect; OpenVitals keeps only local UI preferences such as widget order and mindfulness timer/background-sound settings.

### Period-based detail/list screens

The aligned detail/list screens are:

- steps/activity
- activities
- sleep
- heart
- body
- hydration
- nutrition
- mindfulness
- cycle
- vitals

They all use [`MetricDetailScaffold`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/MetricDetailScaffold.kt) as the shared shell.

The scaffold currently owns:

- pull to refresh
- time range selector
- period navigator
- date picker
- shared error block
- `headerItems` slot
- `content: LazyListScope.(DatePeriod) -> Unit` slot

This is the main reusable architectural frame for metric work in the app today.

### Permission surfaces

Onboarding and Settings are not metric screens, but they are important architectural surfaces because they centralize Health Connect availability and permission management.

Current files:

- [`features/onboarding`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/onboarding)
- [`features/settings`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/settings)

For availability and permission state these screens should keep using `HealthRepository`, not feature repositories.

Settings is one route per section, and each section builds only its own ViewModel: `DisplaySettingsViewModel`, `ActivitiesSettingsViewModel` (recording, offline maps, elevation tiles), `NutritionSettingsViewModel`, `BodySettingsViewModel` (shared by Body profile and Recovery, because the profile, the zones and the night window all feed the Body Energy chain), `DataImportViewModel`, and the bespoke Watches, Scales (`ScalesViewModel`) and Sync with another phone screens. `SettingsViewModel` keeps only the root, Health Connect, Vitals and Diagnostics: availability, permissions, and a few switches. A new section gets its own ViewModel and screen; do not grow `SettingsViewModel`.

### Health Connect screen shell

Health Connect-backed screens (dashboard, metric detail, readiness, manual entry, imports) should wrap content with the shared shell:

- [`HealthConnectFeature`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/healthconnect/HealthConnectFeature.kt) maps destinations to permission sets
- [`HealthConnectScreenUxCoordinator`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/healthconnect/HealthConnectScreenUxCoordinator.kt) loads sync/access/contextual-prompt state
- [`WithHealthConnectFeatureScreen`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/HealthConnectPermissionLauncher.kt) composes access gate, sync banner, contextual promotion, and permission launcher

Metric detail screens pass `syncPaused` from the shell state into `MetricDetailScaffold` and set `showInlineSyncBanner = false` to avoid duplicate banners.

## Cross-Cutting Rules

These five rules hold app-wide. Breaking one is not a local decision.

### 1. Exactly one foreground service at a time

The app treats the Android foreground slot as effectively single. Activity recording, the Apple Health import, and a phone-to-phone sync contend for it, and the app does not run them concurrently:

- [`ActivityRecordingService`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/manualentry/activity/recording/ActivityRecordingService.kt) — `location|health|connectedDevice`.
- [`DeviceSyncForegroundService`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/devicesync/DeviceSyncForegroundService.kt) — `connectedDevice`.
- WorkManager's `SystemForegroundService` — `dataSync`, used by the Apple Health and offline map import workers.

The contention is resolved by refusing, not by queueing: the sync wizard reports `RECORDING_ACTIVE` and `GarminWatchSyncService.sync` refuses outright while a recording is live. A new long-running workflow must either reuse one of these or state which one it excludes. A Garmin watch sync deliberately runs with **no** foreground service of its own; its process-priority story is the companion-device association instead.

The scheduled watch sync inherits that decision rather than escaping it. `WatchAutoSyncWorker` is a plain `CoroutineWorker`, never an expedited or foreground one: work the user did not start must not be able to take the single slot, and it has no business posting a notification about itself. It gets WorkManager's ordinary ten-minute window, which is ample for a watch that syncs every half hour, and it refuses on the same `GarminWatchSyncService.sync` recording gate everything else does.

The bathroom scale is the one service the app starts without a tap. When Android reports the associated scale awake, `XiaomiScaleListener` starts `ScaleListeningService` (`connectedDevice`, silent notification) for at most 45 seconds, because a background app's scan is too slow to catch a result that is on the air for two seconds. Someone stepping on a scale is the user's action; nothing else in the app may copy this. It respects the slot: `ScaleListeningForeground.raise` starts nothing when the app is already at foreground importance, which is the case while a recording, an import or a phone sync holds it, and the scan already runs full time then. Its half-hourly `ScaleListenerWorker` is a plain worker for the same reason the watch one is.

### 2. One BLE radio, leased per address

Every subsystem that opens a BLE link to a device goes through `RadioLeases`. The four owners are `SYNC`, `FIND`, `SETTINGS`, and `NOTIFICATIONS`, and on a given address they mutually exclude: a file sync, a find-my-watch ring, an open settings link, and the notification forwarder cannot hold the same watch at once.

The lease is not just a mutex. Three properties matter:

- Leases expire, so a crashed holder cannot wedge the radio permanently. A fresh lease lasts 30 s, because its holder opens the link before it starts renewing and a connect may take 20 s. A renewed one lasts 15 s.
- `request()` registers a waiter; the current holder's next renew then fails, which is its cue to drop the link. That is how the indefinitely-held notification forwarder and settings link yield to a sync. A waiter expires after 10 s, and `withRadioLease` withdraws its own when the wait ends without the lease.
- Work with an end (`withRadioLease`: a sync, a find, an upload) renews with `yieldToWaiter = false` and keeps the radio until it is done. The waiter gets `RadioLeaseBusyException`.
- `release()` leaves a short settle window rather than clearing the entry, so a new GATT open cannot race the previous teardown.

Live BLE sensor streaming during activity recording lives in `sensors/ble` and targets sensors, not watches; it is excluded from watch work by rule 1 rather than by the lease. New device work must take a lease, and must pick one of the existing owner tags rather than inventing a fifth without a reason.

A lease guards a link. The scale listener opens none: it only scans, and a scan shares the radio with any link. It takes no lease.

### 3. Health Connect reads and record mapping stay behind `healthconnect/*HealthReader`

The per-area readers in [`healthconnect`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/healthconnect) — `ActivityHealthReader`, `SleepHealthReader`, `HeartHealthReader`, `BodyHealthReader`, `VitalsHealthReader`, `HydrationHealthReader`, `NutritionHealthReader`, `MindfulnessHealthReader`, `CycleHealthReader`, `MedicalRecordsHealthReader` — own the record types, the reads, and the mapping into app models. The medical reader and `MedicalRecordsWriter` reach Health Connect through `MedicalRecordsClient`, because the Jetpack medical classes build platform objects in their constructors and a JVM test cannot create them. `HealthConnectMedicalRecordsClient` is the only class that touches them. Repositories consume readers; features consume repositories. No feature should call the AndroidX client or hold a raw `Record` in screen state.

Two bounded exceptions exist today and should stay bounded:

- **Constant vocabularies.** Display code may reference Health Connect's constant sets where the app has no reason to mirror them — `ExerciseSessionRecord` exercise types, `ExerciseSegment`, `MealType`, `SexualActivityRecord` protection values. That is naming, not data access.
- **Write and import paths.** Importers and sync legitimately build `Record` instances. Each concentrates that in one place (`features/imports/applehealth`, `features/imports/csv`, `features/imports/garmin`, `features/devicesync/store/SyncRecordCodec.kt`, `devices/garmin/wellness/FitWellnessImport.kt`, `devices/xiaomi/S400WeighInImport.kt`) and writes through `AppleHealthImportRepository.insertImportedRecords`, which is what makes deterministic `clientRecordId` upserts consistent across all of them. Medical records write through `MedicalRecordsWriter` instead.

**A writer reads strictly.** The readers return a fallback (an empty list, a null) when a read fails, is rate limited, or sync is paused. That suits a screen, which wants an empty state. It is wrong for code that saves what it read: a cache rebuild, a derived-record reconcile. Such code wraps its reads in `withStrictHealthConnectReads { ... }` ([`HealthConnectReaderSupport.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/healthconnect/HealthConnectReaderSupport.kt)). Inside it every guarded read throws instead, in child coroutines too, so the pass aborts before it writes. `VitalsHistorySyncService`, `StepDistanceBackfillService`, `BmrEstimateService` and `BodyEnergyChainSyncService` do this. A new writer must too. So does code that puts what it read into a document the user keeps: `ReportDataLoader` reads strictly, so a rate-limited metric shows as failed in the report and not as "No data in this range". `MedicalRecordsHealthReader` has no fallback at all: every read throws, so a medical screen never shows "no records" for a failed read.

**A writer checks that it can see other apps' data.** In the background, without the background-read grant, Health Connect answers a read with this app's own records only and raises nothing. `HealthConnectManager.readsOtherAppsDataNow()` is the test: a started Activity, or the grant. Code that saves or shows what it read while no Activity is up (a cache rebuild, a reconcile, a widget refresh) calls it first and skips the pass when it is false. A reminder that only needs this app's own entries does not need it.

### 4. A missing permission is a type, not a message

[`Throwable.isPermissionFailure()`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/core/presentation/ScreenError.kt) is the single predicate for "this failed because a permission is missing". It walks the cause chain looking for `SecurityException`, because Health Connect throws that for an ungranted read or write and repositories throw the same type when they short-circuit a call whose permission they know is missing, often wrapped by a repository or worker.

`ScreenErrorHandler.handle` checks that predicate first and returns `ScreenError.PermissionDenied` before it ever considers `throwable.message`. That matters because the screens turn this case into a grant affordance: `ScreenErrorContent` and `MetricDetailScaffold` render `PermissionDenied` as `HealthConnectPermissionDeniedCallout` rather than red error text. Collapsing it into `ScreenError.Message` would silently downgrade a recoverable state into a dead end.

`AppleHealthImportErrorFormatter.isPermissionDenied` delegates to the same predicate so the import card and the screen error path cannot drift apart. Reuse it; do not pattern-match on exception messages.

### 5. Nothing waits on the main thread

A blocked main thread is an "app isn't responding" dialog. A broadcast receiver has about 10 seconds; a touch has 5.

- **Loads start and publish on Main.** `LoadCoordinator.launch(viewModelScope)` runs there, and `_uiState.value = _uiState.value.copy(...)` is only safe there. Move the heavy part with `withContext`, not the whole load.
- **Health Connect and Room calls are `suspend` and run on `dispatchers.io`.** Mappers that walk samples run on `dispatchers.default`. Inject [`DispatcherProvider`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/core/performance/DispatcherProvider.kt) with the `= DefaultDispatcherProvider` default so tests can swap it.
- **No `runBlocking` in `app/src/main`.** `NoRunBlockingRatchetTest` holds the allow-list.
- **A receiver never holds a broadcast for a Health Connect read.** `UpdatingHomeWidgetReceiver` lets Glance redraw from stored state and hands the read to `HomeWidgetRefreshScheduler.refreshNow()`. Do not call `goAsync()` in a Glance receiver: Glance already took the pending result, so a second call returns null.
- **A widget tap writes first.** `runQuickBeverageTap` does the write, then the tile update. The label revert runs on `HomeWidgetScope`, after the broadcast ends. Its time budget stops the wait, never the write.
- **A scale broadcast is stored first.** `ScaleWeighInIngest` folds the frame into Room, then writes to Health Connect on its own scope. The receiver waits at most eight seconds for that. A write that takes longer finishes after the broadcast, and one that fails is retried later.
- **Composables `remember` any pass over samples.** A day of 1 Hz heart rate is about 86,000 samples. Sort, min, max and average belong in `remember(samples)` or in the mapper.

When the dialog does appear, Android keeps the trace. `AnrExitInfo` reads it into the report email and the debug log export. On a device: `adb shell dumpsys activity exit-info tech.mmarca.openvitals`.

## Canonical Detail Feature Pattern

New metric detail work should follow this shape.

### 1. Define a feature-owned contract

At minimum:

- `UiState`
- selected range
- selected date
- loading state
- feature payload
- error state

Keep derived fields in the state only when they genuinely simplify the UI.

### 2. Reuse the shared period model

Today the shared period model is:

- `TimeRange`, `DatePeriod`, `PeriodLoadQuery`, `PeriodWindows`, and `PeriodSelectionDriver` in `core/period`

The feature should load data against the selected period query rather than inventing custom navigation rules.

### 3. Keep the ViewModel in charge

The ViewModel should:

- update range/date
- clamp future navigation
- compute the active period
- call repositories
- expose UI-ready data

Most current ViewModels already follow this shape.

### 4. Use `MetricDetailScaffold` as the shell

The screen should pass shared shell parameters and provide only feature content.

The content lambda should render:

- `Day` mode content
- `Week / Month / Year` content
- optional list/breakdown sections

When registering a new period-based screen, add a `PeriodRangePreferenceKey` and inject `PeriodPreferences` into the screen ViewModel so the saved range is owned with the rest of the feature state. Persist only range changes; selected dates remain screen state.

### 5. Keep visuals local to the feature

If the feature needs a custom chart, row, or timeline, keep it in the feature package unless another feature genuinely needs the same thing.

## Repository Rules For New Work

### Use `HealthRepository` only for app-level concerns

Keep using `HealthRepository` for:

- availability
- permission contract access
- granted/missing permissions

Do not add new feature-detail data methods there unless the app is in a temporary migration step.

### Add or extend feature repositories for feature data

Follow the current pattern:

- `ActivityRepository`
- `SleepRepository`
- `HeartRepository`
- `BodyRepository`
- `HydrationRepository`
- `NutritionRepository`
- `MindfulnessRepository`
- `CycleRepository`
- `CaffeineRepository`
- `BodyEnergyRepository`
- `VitalsRepository`

Each repository should:

- guard required permissions
- call `HealthConnectManager`
- return app models ready for the ViewModel

Not every repository is a Health Connect facade. `GarminWellnessRepository` is a thin seam over a Room DAO for series Health Connect has no type for, `CycleJournalRepository` holds the subjective cycle journal for the same reason, and `BleDeviceRepository`, `PreferencesRepository` and `CyclePreferencesRepository` own app-local device and preference state. Those are the exception. If a new repository is not backed by Health Connect, say in its KDoc why Health Connect cannot own the data.

### Ask for the preferences you use, not the repository

`PreferencesRepository` holds every setting in the app and needs a `Context`, so a ViewModel that injects it cannot be built in a JVM test. Narrow contracts in `data/repository/contract` carve it into the groups screens actually use — `PeriodPreferences`, `DailyGoalPreferences`, `BodyProfilePreferences`, `CalorieDisplayPreferences`, `SleepWindowPreferences`, `NutritionDisplayPreferences`, `HeartThresholdPreferences`, `HydrationGoalPreferences`, `BodyEnergyCalibrationPreferences`, `CaffeineModelPreferences`, `MindfulnessTimerPreferences`, `ActivitySplitPreferences`, `WidgetOrderPreferences`, `RecordingPreferences`, `UnitPreferences`, `OnboardingPreferences`, `HealthConnectPreferences` — and `PreferencesModule` binds each to the repository. `CyclePreferences` is bound to `CyclePreferencesRepository`, a separate store in its own preferences file, because the main repository is at its size ceiling. The Settings screens and the dashboard read too wide a set to fit one, and take the repository. The reminder controllers need a `Context` for the same reason; `HydrationReminderSettings`, `MindfulnessReminderSettings` and `CycleReminderSettings` are the three-method slice a screen uses, bound in `RemindersModule`.

Inject the contract. The ViewModel then needs one constructor, and its test passes `FakePreferences` instead of mocking a hundred members. A route argument is read from the injected `SavedStateHandle` in that same constructor; a test builds the handle with the real argument, so `activityMetricFromRoute` and its `routeId()` inverse are the contract. Add a contract for a new group rather than widening an existing one.

### Keep queries period-oriented

Prefer APIs shaped like:

- `loadXPeriod(PeriodLoadQuery, featureOptions)`
- feature-specific query/result objects when period windows need current, previous, and baseline data

Keep granular APIs only when they are real detail or entry-list reads rather than compatibility paths for migrated screens. Avoid adding an aggregate browser layer unless product direction explicitly reintroduces one.

## What Should Stay Shared vs Local

### Shared

- period calculation and titles
- period/day navigation components
- date picker dialog
- detail-screen scaffold
- pull-to-refresh wrapper
- loading/error components
- general card primitives like `MetricCard`
- general chips and section headers

### Feature-local

- metric-specific charts
- metric-specific timelines
- metric-specific list rows
- metric-specific summaries
- metric-specific empty-state language when the domain meaning differs

## Known Seams And Next Refactors

These are real seams in the current codebase, but they are not urgent enough to block feature work.

### 1. Some screen files are still too broad

Several feature screens still keep route/content/cards/charts in one file.

Good future targets:

- split route/container composables from chart/card/list sections
- keep feature-specific visuals inside the feature package
- move only reusable shell pieces to `ui/components`

### 2. Derived UI summaries should stay ViewModel-prepared

Hydration, nutrition, heart/vitals, and body now prepare common summary values in state. Continue this pattern when a value requires sorting, grouping, or scanning a list.

### 3. Shared UI primitives are still grouped in broad files

For example, [`MetricCard.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/ui/components/MetricCard.kt) currently contains:

- `MetricCard`
- `MetricCardPlaceholder`
- `SourceChip`

`SectionHeader` and `TimeRangeSelector` have since moved out into their own files, which is the direction the rest should follow if shared UI keeps growing.

### 4. Background work is narrow and explicit

Room-backed caching is intentionally narrow: the vitals daily cache, the heart-rate day averages and the beverage catalog, not raw Health Connect records.
The dashboard and daily readiness read Health Connect on every load.
The watch and sync tables (`garmin_wellness_samples`, `garmin_sleep_minutes`, `synced_record_origins`) exist only because Health Connect has no record type for those series; they are not a precedent for mirroring records Health Connect can already hold.
`scale_weigh_ins` holds a weight and a heart rate beside the impedances Health Connect has no type for. That is not a mirror either: the row is what a weigh-in heard in the background waits in until a write is possible, and a later recomputation of body composition needs the weight measured with that impedance.

WorkManager is used for the Apple Health import worker and the offline map import worker because those workflows can be long-running and user-visible.
It is also used for the scheduled jobs: the home widget refresh, [`ScaleListenerWorker`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/devices/xiaomi/ScaleListenerWorker.kt), which only re-arms the scale scan and retries pending weigh-ins, and [`WatchAutoSyncWorker`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/watches/WatchAutoSyncWorker.kt), the per-watch automatic sync a user opts into on the watch's device screen. That worker schedules the sync; it does not implement one. It resolves `DeviceSyncController` and runs exactly the sequence a tap runs, so there is still only one watch-sync path.

Everything else about device work is unchanged: a watch sync and a phone-to-phone sync hold their own coroutine scope, the phone-to-phone one is foreground and user-initiated, and neither has a background variant. `WatchAutoSyncWorker` runs with no foreground service at all, deliberately (see the foreground-slot rule). Do not read it as a general background-sync layer, and do not design new features as if one or a raw-record database already exists.

### 5. Do not over-correct into a universal framework

Still avoid:

- a universal chart abstraction
- a giant base ViewModel hierarchy
- premature multi-module refactors
- a full reducer/effect framework for straightforward screens

## Success Criteria

The architecture is working well when:

- a new metric screen can be added without copying shell UI
- Health Connect reads stay below the feature layer
- feature repositories stay narrow and query-oriented
- screens remain thin
- charts remain understandable because metric-specific visuals stay local
- shared extraction happens for scaffolding, not for semantics
- device protocol code stays transport-free and testable without a radio
- a new device integration adds a port implementation, not a second radio-arbitration scheme
