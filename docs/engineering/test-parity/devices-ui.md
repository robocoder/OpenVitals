# Flutter → Kotlin test-parity matrix: devices / ui / goldens / integration / fixtures

Legend: PORTED = same logic + equivalent assertions (byte fixtures identical unless noted). DIVERGED = covered but weaker/different. MISSING = no Kotlin coverage and JVM-portable. N/A-WIDGET = widget/golden rendering. N/A-FRAMEWORK = Flutter-only plumbing. BLOCKED = the Kotlin behaviour genuinely differs, so porting the case would mean changing production code; see "Blocked on a behavior decision" at the end.

### Blocked on a behavior decision

Porting these would mean changing production code, which this wave does not do.

- test/ui/charts/bar_label_test.dart — a label that does not fit SHRINKS — it does not vanish — Kotlin measures at one size and drops on overflow — there is no shrink-to-fit ladder to assert
- test/ui/charts/bar_label_test.dart — the longer the number, the smaller it is drawn — but it is drawn — Same one-size measurement: no step-down exists in Kotlin
- test/ui/charts/charts_test.dart — periodYearHeatmapCells (rolling) spans across the calendar-year edge — Kotlin's `periodYearHeatmapCells` has no `rolling` parameter — the year heatmap always draws the calendar year of `period.start`
- test/ui/charts/metric_day_chart_test.dart — MetricDayChart > sorts the samples it is handed — Kotlin's `rawDayPlotPoints` plots in caller order; only the bucketed branch sorts, so the guarantee does not exist to assert
- test/ui/components/health_connect_gate_test.dart — shows the access gate when Health Connect is unavailable — Kotlin deliberately routes unavailability out of band (state.availability + the dashboard promo) instead of a blocking gate; the Kotlin test pins that routing
- test/ui/components/health_connect_gate_test.dart — shows the permission gate when a required permission is missing — Kotlin raises a contextual prompt with the child still shown rather than a blocking gate; the Kotlin test pins that divergence
- test/integration/use_cases_test.dart — cycle > day returns over real data — Kotlin's cycle screen is month-anchored: there is no DAY load to exercise
- test/integration/use_cases_test.dart — cycle > week returns over real data — Same month-anchored load — no WEEK range exists on the cycle stack

### Portable gaps

Every remaining MISSING or DIVERGED row. All of them now sit in `features/**`, `data/repository/**` or the repository-level integration surfaces, i.e. outside this wave's file ownership (`test/**/devices/**`, `**/ui/**`, `**/sensors/**`); the devices, charts and fixture areas are closed.

- [DIVERGED] test/ui/charts/metric_day_chart_test.dart — MetricDayChart > off draws the raw readings and no band
- [DIVERGED] test/integration/activity_pipeline_test.dart — a GPS session gets REAL splits, not evenly-estimated ones
- [DIVERGED] test/integration/degraded_device_test.dart — a missing Health Connect is reported as unavailable, not as an error
- [DIVERGED] test/integration/degraded_device_test.dart — a read without its permission returns EMPTY, and does not throw
- [DIVERGED] test/integration/degraded_device_test.dart — holding ONLY the sleep permission still loads sleep, and nothing else
- [DIVERGED] test/integration/degraded_device_test.dart — sync paused degrades reads to empty rather than failing
- [DIVERGED] test/integration/repositories_test.dart — health > availability resolves through the real repository
