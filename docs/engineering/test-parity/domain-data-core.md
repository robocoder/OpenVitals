| availability > resolveFeatureFlags reads optional-feature availability | PORTED | HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt: `optional-feature availability is read per feature`, `planned exercise permissions appear once the provider reports the feature` | Kotlin has no resolve step — the getters ask the provider on demand — so the flags are read straight off the service |
| availability > getFeatureStatus surfaces the tri-state per feature | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | pigeon FeatureStatusMsg tri-state; Kotlin consumes SDK status ints directly |
| availability > UNKNOWN feature status resolves the flag to unavailable | PORTED | HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt: `a feature status this SDK has no name for resolves to unavailable` | the SDK has no UNKNOWN constant, so the case is fed a status int it has no name for; the gate is `== FEATURE_STATUS_AVAILABLE` either way |

| reads > readDailySteps chunks a multi-year range into <=366-day queries | DIVERGED | ActivityHealthReaderTest.kt: `dailyStepDateChunks splits long ranges into inclusive chunks` | helper tiling tested at small scale; 366-day default, per-query span cap, metric set not asserted |

| reads > readDailyHydration sums same-date buckets instead of keeping the last | PORTED | HealthConnectDstBucketTest: `readDailyHydration sums same-date buckets instead of keeping the last` | The `associate {}` let a clipped one-hour DST tail bucket overwrite the whole day; now summed |

| reads > session metrics carry average power, asked for by wire name | DIVERGED | HealthConnectReadMappingTest.kt: `session metrics carry average power` | POWER_AVG aggregate path ported end to end; the wire-name half is pigeon-specific — Kotlin asks with the typed AggregateMetric, so there is no name to mistype |
| reads > an Exercise session carries the record provenance across the bridge | DIVERGED | FixtureReaderTest.kt: `every record keeps the provenance the Pigeon messages kept dropping` | asserts non-null recordingMethod/lastModifiedTime/zone offset; exact values and clientRecordVersion not |
| reads > a Sleep session carries the record provenance the detail screen shows | PORTED | HealthConnectReadMappingTest.kt: `a Sleep session carries the record provenance the detail screen shows` | — |
| reads > a session with no zone offsets keeps them null, not zero | DIVERGED | HealthConnectReadMappingTest.kt: `a session with no zone offsets keeps them null, not zero` | the null-vs-UTC distinction is pinned for both zone offsets; Dart's companion `lastModifiedTime isNull` has no counterpart — Health Connect's Kotlin Metadata carries a non-null lastModifiedTime the provider stamps |
| reads > Weight entries map from typed msgs and preserve ownership | PORTED | HealthConnectReadMappingTest.kt: `Weight entries map from records and preserve ownership` | — |
| writes > writeHydrationEntry forwards a typed request | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | asserts pigeon forwarding only; record build lives in Kotlin reader |

| writes > deleteActivityEntry delegates by id | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | pure passthrough |
| apple health import > insertImportedRecords converts every record to canonical JSON | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | pigeon ImportRecordMsg codec; Kotlin import writes records directly (AppleHealthImportServiceTest covers its own layer) |
| apple health import > findMatchingImportedClientRecordIds maps targetType and filters | PORTED | ImportedClientRecordIdLookupTest.kt | the targetType half is wire-only, but the FILTERING half was Kotlin logic with a bug: a hardcoded `apple_health_` prefix guard discarded every `csv_` id, so the CSV importer could never find a duplicate. Guard removed; the wanted-set is the authority |
| readRawActivityProgress > accumulates each hourly bucket into a running total | DIVERGED | HealthConnectAggregateReadTest.kt: `readRawActivityProgress accumulates each contribution into a running total` | the running total is ported exactly; Kotlin accumulates raw RECORD contributions grouped by end time rather than hourly aggregate buckets, so there are no buckets to count |
| readRawActivityProgress > a metric the device never reports stays null, not a zero line | DIVERGED | HealthConnectAggregateReadTest.kt: `an unrequested metric stays null, while a requested one reads zero` | blocked on behavior decision: Kotlin's nullness follows what was REQUESTED (the granted permissions), not what came back — a requested metric the device never wrote reads 0, not null. Pinned as it stands |
| readRawActivityProgress > a metric stays non-null from the bucket it first appears in | DIVERGED | HealthConnectAggregateReadTest.kt: `a metric's running total carries forward through contributions that had none` | the carry-forward half is ported; the first half cannot hold, since a requested metric is non-null from point one (see the row above) |
| readRawActivityProgress > asks for hourly buckets across the whole of a past day | DIVERGED | HealthConnectAggregateReadTest.kt: `a past day is read across the whole of it, and nothing outside it` | the window is ported (local midnight to the next, with neither neighbouring day leaking in); Kotlin issues no hourly bucket query, so the 60-minute slicer has no counterpart |
| readRawActivityProgress > today stops at now rather than running on to midnight | PORTED | HealthConnectAggregateReadTest.kt: `today stops at now rather than running on to midnight` | asserted through the observable half — a record stamped for later today stays off the line |

| elevation + wheelchair aggregates > return the aggregated value | PORTED | HealthConnectAggregateReadTest.kt: `elevation and wheelchair aggregates return the aggregated value` | — |
| elevation + wheelchair aggregates > stay null when the device records neither | DIVERGED | HealthConnectAggregateReadTest.kt: `elevation and wheelchair read zero, not null, when the device records neither` | blocked on behavior decision: the Kotlin day readers fall back to 0.0/0L, so a day the device never measured is indistinguishable from one it measured as zero. The divergence is now pinned rather than untested |
| elevation + wheelchair aggregates > a wheelchair count is rounded to whole pushes | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | rounding is a Dart double-bridge artifact; Kotlin aggregate returns Long natively |

| planned exercise sessions > an unsupported provider reads empty and refuses to write | MISSING | — | blocked on behavior decision: Kotlin's ActivityHealthReader is ungated — the plannedExercise gate lives one layer up in ActivityRepository.kt:422/435, outside this cluster. The permission half is pinned in HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt `optional-feature availability is read per feature` |

## test/data/source/health/health_permissions_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: app/src/test/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/healthconnect/HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt (Kotlin folds Dart's HealthPermissionService and its HealthConnectFeatureFlags into one class: a Dart flag becomes a `getFeatureStatus` answer, the opt-in becomes the `mindfulnessIntegrationEnabled` lambda)
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |

| phased permission sets > PERMISSION_SET_VERSION is 3 | DIVERGED | HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt: `PERMISSION_SET_VERSION is pinned` | same intent (a bump is a deliberate act), different value: the two apps bumped on different schedules and Kotlin's constant is 2 |

| feature gating > an unavailable mindfulness leaks into NO permission set | PORTED | HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt: `an unavailable mindfulness leaks into NO permission set` | the 1.9.0 regression is now pinned on its own side: eight composed sets plus the onboarding catalog, which drops the category rather than offering an empty row |
| feature gating > an AVAILABLE mindfulness still stays out of the required set | PORTED | HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt: `an AVAILABLE mindfulness still stays out of the required set` | asserted against both required sets Kotlin has — minimumOnboardingPermissions and the catalog's requiredPermissions |
| feature gating > the device answer and the opt-in are separate flags | DIVERGED | HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt: `the device answer and the opt-in are folded into one flag` | blocked on behavior decision: isMindfulnessSessionAvailable() folds the opt-in in FIRST and the catalog's mindfulnessSupportedByDevice reports that same folded answer, so a supporting device whose user has not opted in is indistinguishable from an unsupporting one. The fold is pinned instead of the Dart split |
| feature gating > cycle tracking stays out of the required set, both directions | PORTED | HealthConnectPermissionServiceTest.kt: `cycle tracking stays out of the required set, both directions` | Kotlin has no named cycleWritePermissions set (the cycle writes live inline in dataImportWritePermissions), so the test spells the set out |

Kotlin counterpart: none (Kotlin uses kotlin.Result / runCatching; no AppFailure hierarchy)
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|

Kotlin counterpart: app/src/test/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/core/stats/StatsTest.kt
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| average — null means "no samples" > averages the values | PORTED | StatsTest.kt: `averageOrNull averages a populated list` | — |
| average — null means "no samples" > returns null on empty, never zero | PORTED | StatsTest.kt: `averageOrNull returns null for an empty list rather than NaN` | — |
| average — null means "no samples" > is never NaN | PORTED | StatsTest.kt: `averageOrNull returns null for an empty list rather than NaN` (+ `rounding an empty average throws…`) | — |
| average — null means "no samples" > averages ints and doubles alike | PORTED | StatsTest.kt: `averageOrNull works for long and int samples` | — |
| average — null means "no samples" > a genuine zero average is zero, not null | PORTED | StatsTest.kt: `averageOrNull keeps a genuine zero distinct from no data` | — |

| averageOrZero — zero is a real value > otherwise agrees with average | PORTED | StatsTest.kt: `averageOrZero reports zero only where zero is the answer we want` | asserts the populated value directly rather than cross-checking against average |
| minOf / maxOf > find the extremes | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Kotlin uses stdlib minOrNull/maxOrNull |
| minOf / maxOf > return null on empty rather than throwing | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | null-on-empty is the stdlib contract of minOrNull/maxOrNull |

## test/core/time/local_date_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none (Kotlin uses java.time.LocalDate)
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| withDayOfMonth clamps to the month length (no phantom Feb 31) | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | hand-rolled Dart LocalDate; note java.time.withDayOfMonth THROWS on invalid days rather than clamping — Kotlin callers must not rely on clamping |

## test/bootstrap/background_health_access_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| hands back a data source whose availability is already resolved | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Dart isolate/pigeon handoff of HealthConnectNativeDataSource; Kotlin reads HC directly, availability covered by healthconnect/HealthConnectAvailabilityServiceTest.kt |
| an unavailable provider is an answer, not an error | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Same isolate-handoff contract; no Kotlin analog component |

## test/bootstrap/data_refresh_bootstrap_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| mounting alone does not refresh | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Riverpod DataRefreshBootstrap/RefreshCoordinator does not exist in Kotlin; refresh is per-ViewModel |
| returning to the foreground re-resolves availability and refreshes | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Partially mirrored by DashboardViewModelTest.kt `resumeCurrentDay advances unpinned past date to today`; no availability re-resolve/refresh-signal analog |
| a second resume within the guard interval emits no second signal | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Guard-interval concept exists only in the Flutter bootstrap |
| a resume past the guard interval refreshes again | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Same |
| a resume after the day rolls over refreshes inside the guard interval | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Day-rollover-on-resume behavior mirrored by DashboardViewModelTest.kt resumeCurrentDay tests, different mechanism |

## test/bootstrap/reminder_bootstrap_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: app/src/test/kotlin/tech/mmarca/openvitals/features/hydration/reminders/HydrationReminderControllerTest.kt (partial)
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| restores an enabled reminder and clears a disabled one | DIVERGED | HydrationReminderControllerTest.kt: `enabled config schedules next reminder` / `disabled config clears alarm and notification` (and Mindfulness twin) | Per-feature sync semantics covered; the app-start/BootReceiver restore path itself is untested in Kotlin |
| starts the alarm service on Android (for the widget refresh) | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Flutter android_alarm_manager service init; Kotlin uses AlarmManager directly |
| does not touch the alarm service off Android | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Flutter platform switch; Kotlin is Android-only |
| a failed time-zone init still restores the schedules | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Dart timezone-package init; Kotlin uses the system zone, no init step |
| a throwing time-zone init is swallowed and does not abort startup | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Same |
| a throwing alarm service is swallowed and schedules still restore | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Flutter alarm-service plumbing only |

## test/bootstrap/reminder_resume_bootstrap_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| returning to the foreground re-plans both reminder batches | PORTED | ReminderRestoreBootstrapTest.kt | the dismissal was wrong twice over: nothing re-planned on resume, AND alarms do not always persist — a reminder firing without POST_NOTIFICATIONS cancels its own alarm and never reschedules, and that permission is auto-revoked for unused apps. ReminderRestoreBootstrap now restores both on every foreground, each in its own runCatching |
| a failed hydration re-plan neither escapes the lifecycle handler nor blocks mindfulness | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Same |

## test/bootstrap/reminder_tap_bootstrap_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| a tapped reminder opens the route its payload names | N/A-WIDGET | — | Router pump via widget tester; Kotlin tap routing is a PendingIntent, untested |

Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|

## test/contract/kotlin_msg_population_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| the fields Kotlin hard-codes to null are exactly these | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Golden set over the pigeon native readers in the Flutter repo; the Kotlin app has no Msg layer |

## test/contract/local_day_fixture_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| test fixtures derive calendar days from LocalDate, not hour offsets | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Lint of the Dart test suite's fixture style; Kotlin tests use java.time directly |

## test/contract/pigeon_domain_contract_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| ${binding.msg} <-> ${binding.domain} > every domain field can actually be populated (per binding) | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Pigeon Msg<->domain contract; no pigeon boundary in the Kotlin app |
| ${binding.msg} <-> ${binding.domain} > every Msg field is accounted for (per binding) | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Same |
| ${binding.msg} <-> ${binding.domain} > the binding table names fields that exist (per binding) | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Same |

## test/di/reminder_scheduler_wiring_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| hydration reminders use the batch scheduler on TargetPlatform.android / .iOS (x2) | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Riverpod DI wiring for the Flutter batch-notification scheduler; Kotlin uses AlarmManager one-shot reminders (controller-tested) |
| mindfulness reminders use the batch scheduler on TargetPlatform.android / .iOS (x2) | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Same |
| the two reminders use distinct notification id ranges | PORTED | ReminderSchedulerWiringTest.kt: `the two reminders use distinct notification id ranges` | — |

Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |
|---|---|---|---|

| the app offers only SHIPPED locales > every shipped language, and nothing that has no AppLanguage constant | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Same |
| the app offers only SHIPPED locales > an in-progress locale is NOT offered, even once gen-l10n knows it | N/A-FRAMEWORK | — | Weblate in-progress-ARB gating is a Flutter-repo concept |

Kotlin counterpart: none
| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |

### Blocked on a behavior decision

Kotlin behaves differently from Flutter here, or the seam the Flutter test
Rows reclassified during the latest porting wave carry N/A-BEHAVIOR with a
"blocked on behavior decision" note in place, rather than being repeated here:
the watch-fit watermark use case, the history-sync drain isolation and re-drain,
the Flutter-side anti-clobber migration guard, the reminder-apply serialization,
the mid-load display clear, and the unsupported-write-permission filter.
