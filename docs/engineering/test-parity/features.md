# Flutter → Kotlin test-parity matrix: features section

Scope: test/features/ minus manualentry/, hydration/, mindfulness/, caffeine/, nutrition/ (owned by another agent) and minus dashboard/, devicesync/, imports/applehealth/, body/, cycle/, recovery/ (persisted separately). Covered here: activity (incl. maps/ and export/), settings, imports/csv + route imports, sleep, heart, vitals, bodyenergy, readiness, achievements, homewidgets, onboarding.

Statuses: PORTED (same logic + equivalent assertions), DIVERGED (covered but weaker/different assertions), MISSING (no Kotlin coverage and portable to a JVM unit test), N/A-WIDGET (widget/golden case with no JVM-portable core), N/A-FRAMEWORK (Flutter-only plumbing, or an Android surface only instrumentation can drive), N/A-BEHAVIOR (the Kotlin behavior itself differs, so a 1:1 test cannot pass without changing production).

| a recorded value is shown even when the type says it is irrelevant | PORTED | ActivityMetricRelevanceTest.kt: `a recorded value is shown even when the type says it is irrelevant` | seam showsMetricRow |
| a walking activity recorded by a watch > shows the totals its session record never carried | N/A-BEHAVIOR | none | blocked on behavior decision - Kotlin has no window-aggregate session-metrics backfill at all (same gap as the activity_backfill rows in domain-data-core.md) |
| a walking activity recorded by a watch > derives a distance from speed when no distance was written | PORTED | ActivityDetailViewModelTest.kt: `initial load backfills missing averages from samples`; ActivityBackfillTest.kt: `a recorded distance beats one integrated from speed` |  |
| a walking activity recorded by a watch > a failing metrics read costs the numbers, not the screen | PORTED | ActivityDetailViewModelTest.kt: `a failing marker read costs the marks, not the screen` | Kotlin folds the session metrics into loadWorkout, so the marker read is the degrading read that stands in for Flutter's separate metrics read; it too is guarded now |

| with no route and no speed samples the card says ESTIMATED and explains why | PORTED | ActivitySplitsTest.kt: `every estimated split shares the activity average pace, and the source says so` | explanatory copy widget-only |
| a failing speed read degrades to estimated splits instead of blowing up the screen | PORTED | ActivityDetailViewModelTest.kt: `a failing speed read degrades to estimated splits instead of blowing up the screen` | fixed: loadSpeedSamples degrades to empty, so the splits fall back to ESTIMATED |

| LoadActivityDetailUseCase heart-rate recovery > the observed maximum is used, and is not an estimate | PORTED | HeartRateRecoveryTest.kt: `the same peak against a KNOWN max is submaximal (tighter band)` (asserts maxUsed + estimated=false), `an observed max below the trust bar is not used as a maximum` | Kotlin additionally keeps an explicit-max rung Flutter removed |

## test/features/activity/maps/mapsforge_label_geometry_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none

The Kotlin app renders Mapsforge maps with the native `org.mapsforge` `TileRendererLayer` (MapsforgeRouteMap.kt), which draws labels inside the library; the Flutter label-layer geometry (visibleLabelTileRange / labelPaintTransform) is a Flutter-only re-implementation that has no Kotlin analog.

## test/features/activity/maps/mapsforge_tile_renderer_test.dart
Kotlin counterpart: none

The tile-render coordination (single reader warm-up, render concurrency cap, byte-budget cache, empty-tile memoization) is a Flutter re-implementation; Kotlin gets all of this from native `TileRendererLayer` + `AndroidUtil.createTileCache` (MapsforgeRouteMap.kt:188-211).

| Flutter case | Status | Kotlin test | Note |

Kotlin counterpart: none

The same one-word policy choice exists in Kotlin: `MultiMapDataStore(MultiMapDataStore.DataPolicy.DEDUPLICATE)` at MapsforgeRouteMap.kt:195. The mapsforge datastore/reader classes are pure Java, so this contract suite is JVM-portable — classified MISSING, not N/A.

Kotlin counterpart: none

Both providers are Flutter adapters (flutter_map ImageProvider / vector_map_tiles). Kotlin renders Mapsforge packs with the native library layer and PMTiles directly through MapLibre's `pmtiles://` source URLs (OfflineRouteMap.kt:432) — no hand-written tile provider exists.

## Summary

Counts are per Flutter test case. The csv_row_converter_test.dart row is collapsed in its table but counted at its true size (43 cases, all PORTED).

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| PORTED | 502 |
| DIVERGED | 70 |
| MISSING | 27 |
| N/A-WIDGET | 134 |
| N/A-FRAMEWORK | 132 |
| N/A-BEHAVIOR | 7 |
| Total cases | 872 |

### Portable gaps

Remaining MISSING cases. Every one is blocked on a **feature that was never ported**
(Body Energy diagnostics) or a **seam owned by another workstream** (features/readiness).
Rows that were blocked on a *behavior decision* or on an **instrumentation-only** Android
surface are no longer listed here — they now carry N/A-BEHAVIOR / N/A-FRAMEWORK with the
reason in their Note column.

- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_card_test.dart: warns when more than one app wrote active calories
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_card_test.dart: says so when no watch samples are stored
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: the component decomposition > activity uses the per-point max, never the sum
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: the component decomposition > a tie counts as the calorie estimate winning
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: the component decomposition > buckets with no activity drain count for neither side

- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: clipping > a ledger that does not balance is flagged
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: the watch totals > are delta sums, not start minus end
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: the watch totals > are absent when the watch never synced that day
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: the watch totals > drainError is signed so an over-draining model is visible
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: per-influence errors > are signed, count-weighted, and omit unobserved influences
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: source attribution > flags a day two apps both wrote active calories for
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: source attribution > stays quiet when one app wrote them
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: source attribution > does not confuse two metrics for two calorie sources
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: toReportText > is stable, explicit, and carries the decisive figures
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: toReportText > names missing permissions rather than showing an empty report
- test/features/settings/body_energy_diagnostics_test.dart: toReportText > says so when the per-source read was truncated
- test/features/readiness/readiness_display_test.dart: daily readiness panel > composes every line the panel used to build inline
- test/features/readiness/readiness_display_test.dart: daily readiness panel > an empty insight still composes: no strain, no score, no factors
- test/features/readiness/readiness_display_test.dart: daily readiness panel > the factor list is capped at five
- test/features/readiness/readiness_display_test.dart: training readiness detail > score, verdict, confidence, signals and guidance
- test/features/readiness/readiness_display_test.dart: training readiness detail > no training-side factors falls back to the no-signals message
- test/features/readiness/readiness_display_test.dart: training readiness detail > an unknown state reads as needs-more-data, whatever the score
- test/features/readiness/readiness_display_test.dart: training readiness detail > the verdict bands
- test/features/readiness/readiness_display_test.dart: training readiness detail > the strain bullet always renders, from the state
- test/features/readiness/training_readiness_details_view_model_test.dart: a failed load becomes a ScreenError, not an exception
